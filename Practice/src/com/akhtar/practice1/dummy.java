		/* HashMap is like a data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. 
		Internally, it uses an array of buckets, where each bucket holds entries (nodes).
		Each node contains a key, its value, the hash of the key, 
		and a pointer to the next node (in case of collisions).

		ðŸŸ© Step-by-step: How HashMap Stores Data
		When you use:

		
		map.put("abc", 123);
		Java calls "abc".hashCode() to generate a hash number.

		It calculates the bucket index using this hash:
			index = (n - 1) & hash;
		where n is the current size of the array (default is 16).

		If the bucket at index is empty:

		It creates a new node and puts it there.

		If the bucket already has something (hash collision):

		It checks if the key already exists using .equals().

		If yes, it updates the value.

		If no, it adds the new node at the end of the linked list in that bucket.

		If more than 8 nodes exist in one bucket â†’ it converts the list to a Red-Black Tree for faster search.
		
		How HashMap Retrieves Data
		When you use:

		map.get("abc");
		HashMap calculates the hash and index again using the same method.

		Goes to that bucket and:

		If one node exists, checks the key using .equals() and returns the value.

		If a list/tree exists, it searches each node or tree node using .equals() to find the key.*/
